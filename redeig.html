Users can compare prices and shipping options. When I Joined the team in 2019, Torob had 3 million active users per month and in 2021 it rose to 7 million. As the sole product designer, I was responsible for the design of the Torob website and Android app.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the following, I've described my works at Torob in chronological order.

Redesigning Interface Of Website And Android App</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">My first work at Torob was redesigning the interface of the Android app and website. There were some known problems in the user interface which affect the users' experience and key metrics of the business. </span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Problems</span></h3><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Visual Inconsistency</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">: Torob didn't have a style guide for design and development and it caused a wide inconsistency in the website and Android app. On some pages, it was confusing for users to find desired links and main actions.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Poor Navigation:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Putting navigation in the back of the hamburger menu made it hard to find that.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sketchy Responsive Design:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Half of Torob traffic comes from Google via mobile devices. The landing pages for this huge traffic were not optimized for fast loading and needed a more light and clear design.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Poor Readability:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Some important text had low contrast and a small font size.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Overuse Of Brand Color:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> The over use of red color made it hard for users to detect main actions and cause a feeling of errors on pages.</span></p></div></div><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-old-design-mobile.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"></figure><h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solutions and Tests</span></h3><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1. Developing A Design System: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We developed a design system for Torob. It helped us to keep consistency through all products. After designing fundamental UI elements, we designed pages with high fidelity and keep developing them for new features and adapting them for Android application.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-design-system.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"></figure><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2. Visual And Navigation Improvement: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We replaced the hamburger menu with the bottom navigation bar and used a less saturated red color for main actions. The Below image shows visual change on the product page in mobile view and desktop.</span></p><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-product-page-mobile.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"><figcaption>The product page on mobile</figcaption></figure><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-product-page-desktop-3.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1500"><figcaption>The product page on desktop</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>The following images show the new look of the browse page in the mobile and website.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-browse-mobile.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"><figcaption>The browse page on mobile</figcaption></figure><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-browse-desktop-2.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1500"><figcaption>The browse page on small desktop</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p class="p1"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">3. Improved Responsive Design: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Torob website is seen by a wide range of different devices. The “Product Pages” are the most important page on the Torob website. 80% of users see at least one product page in their sessions and 95% of Google searches are directed to these pages. So we considered a wide different screen sizes in the design to ensure a seamless experience for all users.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-Product-page-at-different-device-size.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"></figure><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">4. A/B Tests: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We did a lot of A/B tests on visual designs to ensure the new design didn't have negative effects on critical metrics. For example, in the following chart, you can see a test on the store card on the product page. We wanted to know the effect of linking the store name to its profile on Buy Button clicks. It was a tiny visual change of the store's name but it caused a 14% drop in clicks.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-shop-link-ab-test.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1290"><figcaption>A/B test on adding store profile link</figcaption></figure><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We did other similar tests like Buy Button color, adding the city of the store, adding shipping info which help us to make better decisions on the design process.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-web-app-installation-modal-ab-test.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1500"><figcaption>A/B test on web app installation modal</figcaption></figure><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">5. Gradual Release: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We tested the new design of Torob on the desktop website which had about 15% of all traffics and monitored critical metrics for 2 weeks. After that, we released it for all web users. We had the same approach for the Android app and used Google Play Staged Rollouts to release new designs gradually. During releases, we worked closely with the customers' care team to follow the comments of users on the Play store and social networks.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">6. Collecting Data: </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We needed data to understand users' behaviors and measure the effects of new designs. We used Amplitude for short-term testing and our database for collecting long-term data. Also, we did some surveys to understand personas and continuously observe users' behavior to adapt design based on their needs.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">6.1.</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> In the below chart you can see how users reach their desired products through the different sections of the Android app and website. From this data, we understood every platform observes different persona and users have different behaviors on them. So we should consider different designs for every platforms.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-clicks-on-different-platforms.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"></span></figure><p></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">6.2.</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong> Similar Product:</strong> We found how a small change in UI can have a dramatic effect on business metrics and users experience. Similar products was a section at the bottom of every product page. Previously the Similar section showed limited numbers of products and we tested an infinite scroll section. In the below chart you can see its dramatic effect on Buy Button's clicks on overall web and app platform which is directly related to revenue. The new design also had a positive effect on sessions time.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-Similar-design.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"><figcaption>Effect of the new design of the Similar product section</figcaption></figure><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Case 2: Redesigning Search Experience</span></h2><h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Introduction </span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Data from our first studies (as explained in case 1) showed more than 65% of products visits did through searches. So we decided to consider Search as the first step for UX improvements after UI redesign. The following figure shows the old design of the Search Tab in the Android app. It showed an infinite list of top visited products from the previous day and by typing in the search box, the users saw Suggestions by categories and text. During initial studies, we found some problems and issues and tried to solve them.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-old-search-design.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"></figure><h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Problems</span></h3><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">No reaction to new products, events, and trends</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">: We found the Torob app doesn’t show any reaction to new products and trends in the market. Torob missed or showed delayed reaction to short events like Black Friday or seasonal auctions. For example, we trace PS5 in the first days of its release and found that users couldn’t see any trace of it in the app except by searching the exact name of it. Also, the list of top visited products in Search Tab didn't show any trace of new products except for some new mobile phones. Because mobile phones were the most visited category in Torob and always got top places in the most visits products. At that moment, the current algorithm just considered absolute values of all product visits, so it couldn't detect trends and growth of new terms in the search. </span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Poor UX of Repeated Searches:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Considering similar services and best practices of big shopping websites showed users do a lot of similar searches during different sessions. Torob didn't have any facilities for repeated searches in the old design.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solutions and tests</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We decided to use users' search queries and product visits to detect trends and growth of new queries and show them to users. It could show users that Torob is an alive and up-to-date place for trends. As seen in the following figure, we replaced the list of top visited products with two sections. The first section represent products from the most visited categories through search and the second section displayed top and trend queries from the previous day. </span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To improve the experience of repeated search, we added two new sections to the user's searches history: the history of products that the user visited through searches and the history of user queries. </span></p><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-new-search-design.webp" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"></figure><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To test the new features, we released a test version with a new design for a limited group of users by Google Play and using Amplitude to measure events. We define two events for every search type:</span></p><ol><li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Product Visit (PV):</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Opening a product page</span></li><li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Buy Button (BB):</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Clicks on Buy Button on the products page. This button is the main action in the product page that redirects users to the seller website and Torob charges sellers for clicks on this button.</span></li></ol><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The following charts show data for 30 days of the test version which was released for 10 percent of users. In every chart data is grouped by different search types that defined in this way:</span></p><ol><li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Direct:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> User hit the enter key after typing in the search field and don’t choose any suggestions.</span></li><li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Suggestion:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> User chooses a suggestion after typing in the search field.</span></li><li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">History:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> User clicked on his/her history search.</span></li><li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Top product:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> User clicked on top product images.</span></li><li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Top query:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> User clicked on top queries text.</span></li><li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Voice:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> User searched by voice command.</span></li></ol><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The chart below shows </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Product Visit (PV)</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> based on search types.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2021-08-18-at-4.22.15-PM.png" alt="" width="2178" height="1036"><figcaption><span class="author-d-4z65zz66zl57z75zyiz66zfr2fz87zwz89znuiz90zz76zz68z7z86zz78z0oz74zyz85zxz74zjkn6gtnpz79zvz80z7z65zz82zz81zz87z">Product Visit</span> <span class="author-d-4z65zz66zl57z75zyiz66zfr2fz87zwz89znuiz90zz76zz68z7z86zz78z0oz74zyz85zxz74zjkn6gtnpz79zvz80z7z65zz82zz81zz87z h-lparen">(PV)</span><span class="author-d-4z65zz66zl57z75zyiz66zfr2fz87zwz89znuiz90zz76zz68z7z86zz78z0oz74zyz85zxz74zjkn6gtnpz79zvz80z7z65zz82zz81zz87z"> grouped by search types</span></figcaption></figure><p>This chart shows total events of clicks on the Buy Button (BB) grouped by search type.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Screen-Shot-2021-08-18-at-4.19.47-PM.png" alt="" width="2178" height="1036"><figcaption><span class="author-d-4z65zz66zl57z75zyiz66zfr2fz87zwz89znuiz90zz76zz68z7z86zz78z0oz74zyz85zxz74zjkn6gtnpz79zvz80z7z65zz82zz81zz87z">Click on Buy Button</span> <span class="author-d-4z65zz66zl57z75zyiz66zfr2fz87zwz89znuiz90zz76zz68z7z86zz78z0oz74zyz85zxz74zjkn6gtnpz79zvz80z7z65zz82zz81zz87z h-lparen">(BB)</span><span class="author-d-4z65zz66zl57z75zyiz66zfr2fz87zwz89znuiz90zz76zz68z7z86zz78z0oz74zyz85zxz74zjkn6gtnpz79zvz80z7z65zz82zz81zz87z"> grouped by search types</span></figcaption></figure><p>Top Query and Top Product has only about 5% of total product visits but if we look at the conversion rate (CR) of search type (BB/PP, ratio of click per visit) in the below chart, there is not a great gap between search types.

Hand-Picked Content On First Page:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> In co-op with the marketing team, we consider different ideas and decided to add some new rows on the Offer page which presented a collection of new and favorite products on the Offer page. We wanted to measure the effect of these hand-picked content on Window Shopper persona behavior. The results were pretty good and it cause a rise in clicks (directly related to revenue) and session time on the Offer page. Therefore we designed a panel for the marketing team to facilitate hand-picking products and collecting deeper data to measure the effect of any row on the Offer page</span></p><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-android-new-offer.png" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"><figcaption>The new Offer tab design</figcaption></figure><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2.

We found in some layouts we got 2 times more clicks in comparison to other rows. The below chart shows daily clicks on every row on the Offer Page and the red line 🌶 shows the effect of Top Queries related rows. So we created some automatic lists of products based on Top Queries and Top Views which could be presented like hand-picked content on the first page.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-offer-design-row-data.png" alt="" width="1600" height="994"></figure><p><strong>3. Spotlight On Search: </strong>The main experience of Torob was searching but in the first page of app, we just represented it by a small icon. We needed to put a spotlight on search. As explained in case 2, we had a successful experience on redesigning search tab. So we decided to test switching Search tab with Offer tab. We merge the best practices of Search tab with hand-picked content and leave commercial rows on Offer tab.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img src="https://tahamousavi.github.io/media/posts/3/Torob-android-switch-search-tab.png" alt="" width="1600" height="1300"><figcaption>Switching Search with Offer tab.
